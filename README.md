## Description

This website allows users to search for a specific country. When a user makes a search, the website retrieves data from the back-end server. Then, it presents the relevant information about the searched country on the front-end, which is built using React.

## Back-end

In the home directory, start the server by running:

- npm run dev

## Front-end

Make sure you cd into the /client directory and to start the client run:

- npm start
